# Global Air Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis

![Air Quality Banner](https://i.imgur.com/6E3w8Cg.png)

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global air quality dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into air pollution patterns, identify relationships between different pollutants, and explore the influence of meteorological factors on air quality across various cities worldwide.

The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) that walks through the data cleaning, processing, visualization, and interpretation steps.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Global Air Quality Dataset" from Kaggle. It contains 10,000 records of air quality measurements from 27 cities across 21 countries.

### Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `City`: Name of the city
- `Country`: Name of the country
- `Date`: Date of the measurement
- `PM2.5`: Particulate Matter 2.5 concentration (in µg/m³)
- `PM10`: Particulate Matter 10 concentration (in µg/m³)
- `NO2`: Nitrogen Dioxide concentration (in ppb)
- `SO2`: Sulfur Dioxide concentration (in ppb)
- `CO`: Carbon Monoxide concentration (in ppm)
- `O3`: Ozone concentration (in ppb)
- `Temperature`: Temperature (in °C)
- `Humidity`: Humidity (in %)
- `Wind Speed`: Wind speed (in km/h)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the analysis, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

### Prerequisites

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `folium`
- `geopy`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirQualityEDA.git
    cd AirQualityEDA
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: I will create a `requirements.txt` file in the next step.)*

### Usage

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open `EDA.ipynb`:**
    Click on the `EDA.ipynb` file in the Jupyter file browser to open the notebook.

3.  **Run the cells:**
    You can run the cells individually or all at once to see the analysis and visualizations.

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

The EDA covers the following aspects:

-   **Data Cleaning:** Checking for missing values and duplicates.
-   **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.
-   **Univariate Analysis:** Exploring the distribution of each variable.
-   **Bivariate Analysis:** Investigating the relationships between pairs of variables.
-   **Multivariate Analysis:** Visualizing the interactions between multiple pollutants.
-   **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping the air quality data to visualize geographical patterns.
-   **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzing trends and seasonality in air quality over time.

### Key Visualizations

Here are some of the visualizations you will find in the notebook:

-   Histograms and box plots for each numerical feature.
-   A correlation matrix heatmap to show the relationships between variables.
-   Scatter plots to explore the impact of weather conditions on PM2.5 levels.
-   An interactive world map with markers for each city, showing the average PM2.5 levels.
-   Time series plots to visualize daily and monthly trends in air quality.

## 💡 Key Findings

-   The dataset is relatively clean, with no missing values.
-   `PM2.5` and `PM10` show a moderate positive correlation.
-   Air quality varies significantly across different cities and countries.
-   There are some observable trends and seasonality in the time series data.
